description: 'Fundaci√≥n Goethe is a non-profit foundation whose goal is to create socio-economic connections between Germany and Spain through culture. I created the design in Figma and then transferred it to my Eleventy starter. For most of the CSS I used Tailwind CSS, the functionality for menu and accordion comes from Alpine.js.  The client wanted a colourful, modern and fast website, where they could present their artists, venues and patrons each on their own pages. In addition, the site needed to be bilingual. The two languages are located in separate folders with their own structure, links between the two languages work via a key in the frontmatter. The locales are referenced in the global data files. The most important element of the website are the events. These are highlighted if they are in the future or placed in the archive if they have already taken place. The archive is an accordion filtered by years and months, so that all past events can be selected quickly. I also took care of the search engine optimisation. The client and I can easily view the statistics via plausible.io. All elements, including Youtube videos, are incorporated in a data protection-compliant manner, which is why a cookie consent is not necessary. '
