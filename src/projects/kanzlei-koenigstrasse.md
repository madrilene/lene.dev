description: 'Customers were already familiar and happy with Wordpress, so this system was maintained. Design was delivered in Figma. The English section has been expanded and unnecessary auxiliary plugins have been reduced to a minimum. All necessary functions are provided by the theme itself. However, there was a lot of technical debt, which is why I started from scratch. Only the existing contents were imported, then sorted into appropriate custom post types (previously all contents were unsorted in "pages"). A lot of restructuring was done and formerly independent routes were sorted into superior areas, where they are now accessible in an accordeon. To save the good SEO rankings as much as possible, all changed routes were stored as redirects in the htaccess. '
technologies:
  - Wordpress with ACF, Gravity Forms, WPML
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Custom minimal vanilla JS
