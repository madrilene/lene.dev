			"title": "Javascript Cookbook",
			"opinion": "By far my favourite Javascript book and the one I would recommend to anyone with a bit of basic knowledge. At no point did I have the feeling of being left behind, all the examples are simple and true to life, the code wonderfully comprehensible. I don't think there's a single foo-bar-baz example except for one, which I really appreciate - I can't be bothered with these placeholders at all, they're totally unlikeable to me. The book even has a bit of humour in many places. I really enjoyed reading it and I always have it near me to look something up.",

			"title": "You Don't Know Javascript Yet: Get Started",
			"opinion": "Another javascript book that I enjoyed very much. Kyle Simpson is renowned in the community for his consistent affection for classic Javascript elements like var and the equality operator, but if you know a bit about the different opinions (which overwhelmingly disagree with him) it's almost refreshing to read a fervent admirer of the pre-ES6 days. Apart from that, he explains the basic workings of Javascript with comprehensible code examples and the book was crucial for me to understand concepts like closure, prototypes and scope.",

			"title": "SVG Animations",
			"opinion": "Not quite up to date as far as browser compatibility is concerned, but great fun to learn how to work with SVG and especially the animation of SVG. The book works best when you actively work with it. I haven't finished it yet, but I'm looking forward to picking it up again.",
