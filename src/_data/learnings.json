      "year": 2023,
      "medium": "book",
      "topic": "CSS",
      "opinion": "... have I read it completely? Of course not! It has over 1000 pages. But I'm on it. I'm actually planning to read it cover to cover, and I'm somewhere on page 240, but I keep reaching for it to look up a particular chapter. It's a treasure trove, and also lovingly and humorously written. A must have. ",

      "year": 2021,
      "medium": "book",
      "topic": "Javascript",
      "opinion": "By far my favourite Javascript book and the one I recommend to anyone with basic knowledge. At no point did I have the feeling of being left behind, the code examples are simple and true to life and wonderfully comprehensible. There's but one foo-bar-baz example (and I think it got in there by accident), which I really appreciate. The book even shows a sense of humour. I really enjoyed reading it and I always have it near me to look something up.",

      "opinion": "This is one of the books that was a real eye-opener for me. I have always used the command line very dubiously and without much background knowledge, and this book has opened up a world for me. I really enjoyed reading it, it's entertaining and doesn't get unnecessarily complex at any point.",
