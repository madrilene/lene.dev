## A little bit about me

I consider myself part of a group of people who want to build a human-centered web. As Michelle Barker states in her [manifesto](https://humanewebmanifesto.com/), I strive to make all my projects accessible, inclusive, sustainable, safe, secure, resilient, reliable and independent.

Hi, I'm Lene. I have been doing web design and development (mainly frontend) for a living since 2008. I was born in Berlin and have been living for over a decade in Madrid. I work with clients all over the world.

I write code according to the principles <q>Content over code</q> and [Rule of Least Power](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html): HTML first, everything what's possible with CSS, and JavaScript only for selected interactivity, polyfills and accessibility.

I really like to organize my projects well so that I and others can always manage them with ease. I share insights that I think might be of interest to the community on a blog on my website [lenesaile.com](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/blog/). I'm a big fan of [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and build most of my projects with it.

Lately I have been diving deep into (HTML) <sparkly-text number-of-sparkles="5" style="--sparkly-text-color: var(--color-primary)">**web components**</sparkly-text>  and I'm integrating them everywhere I can.

(Disclaimer: I am currently updating this site. Things might be a little off.)
