## About me

I have always enjoyed experimenting with computers. In 2004, I tried building my first websites with HTML and CSS. Four years later, I started earning a living with my hobby. Since 2010, I have been living and working in Madrid. I have worked as a freelancer mainly on small to medium-sized business websites.

After reaching my limits with static websites, I discovered Wordpress. Theme platforms like Themeforest didn't exist yet, so I messed around with the default theme until I liked the way it looked. Next, I played around with PHP to broaden the possibilities. For a long time I didn't have the confidence to learn Javascript properly. A few years ago, I started studying it after all. Now I really enjoy experimenting with Javascript.

In 2018 I discovered Jamstack and soon after changed all my (somewhat antiquated) methods. I started integrating Git by default for all projects, tested new bundlers, CSS and Javscript frameworks and discovered the wonderful world of Continuous deployments via GitHub and Netlify. Goodbye FTP.

As far as Javascript frameworks are concerned, [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) appeals to me the most. I also want to learn more about [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Slinkity](https://slinkity.dev/).

I take accessibility and performance very seriously, testing and re-testing until the result is what I want it to be. Which is (as close as I can get to) perfect.

I'm constantly reading and learning, and I'm especially enthusiastic about everything that's happening in the areas of Jamstack, accessibility and performance. I don't consider myself an expert anywhere, as I'm constantly optimising and every field is incredibly large. But I am a quick and flexible learner and have no trouble familiarising myself with new methods and techniques. And I am a practised solution-seeker on Google.
